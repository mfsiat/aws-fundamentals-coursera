# Amazon EFS Notes

- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable, elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is straightforward to use, and it offers a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.

- Amazon EFS is designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances. This enables your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS that scale as a file system grows, with consistent low latencies.

- When an Amazon EFS file system is mounted on Amazon EC2 instances, it provides a standard file system interface and file system access semantics, which allows you to seamlessly integrate Amazon EFS with your existing applications and tools. Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, thus allowing Amazon EFS to provide a common data source for workloads and applications that run on more than one Amazon EC2 instance.
