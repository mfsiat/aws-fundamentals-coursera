# Monitoring and Amazon CloudWatch Notes 
> Amazon CloudWatch

- Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS Cloud resources and the applications that you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.
Amazon CloudWatch Events

- Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs Metrics

- You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Route 53, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs.

- You can collect metrics from servers by installing the CloudWatch agent on the server. You can install the agent on both Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, and on servers that run either Linux or Windows Server.
