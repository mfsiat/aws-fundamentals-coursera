# Welcome to AWS Fundamentals: Migrating to the Cloud

- Throughout this class, there will be additional readings, and other resources. If you are new to AWS, we strongly suggest that you take AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud Native course available on Coursera to provide an introduction to AWS concepts and services.

- Labs

    - Hands-on labs are available, though not required for this class.
    - Access to the labs is limited to paid enrolled students. 

- The labs are hosted on the Vocarium Cloud Lab Platform and provide access to AWS resources as needed to complete the exercise without additional cost. 

- You can audit this course without taking the labs. As we dive into each of the services covered in this class, there will be links to documentation where you can find example applications and code samples that you can try (costs may apply). 

- **Again, Welcome to AWS Fundamentals: Migrating to the cloud! We hope you enjoy the journey! Seph, Sean, Rick**
