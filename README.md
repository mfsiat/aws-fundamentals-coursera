# AWS 
> what is aws and how to use it? 

## Basic 

- Mainly aws is a computer which is hosted on the cloud. 

- We just upload the website on the aws.

- All our files are kept separately on aws so that it becomes faster. 

- To reduce redundency we are going towards the virtual servers. 

- Physical servers are not being used anymore. 

- Physical servers are expensive and it needs to many people to maintain. 

- Virtual servers like **aws**, **azure** etc are very fast and don't need that much people to operate. 

- We just need to define the structure and configuration and all the things are maintained by *aws* by themselves. 

- You don't have to spent much on servers you just **pay as you go**.
