# Amazon RDS Notes

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it straightforward to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as provisioning hardware, setting up the database, patching, and making backups.

Amazon RDS currently supports six database engines:

  -  Amazon Aurora: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/
  -  PostgreSQL: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/
  -  MySQL: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/
  -  MariaDB: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/
  -  Oracle: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/
  - Microsoft SQL Server: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/

You can use the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) (https://aws.amazon.com/dms) to quickly and securely migrate your databases to AWS.

Amazon RDS is eligible for the AWS Free Tier. More details on pricing for Amazon RDS are available here: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/
